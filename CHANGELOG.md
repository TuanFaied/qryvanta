All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Connection profiles (`internal/connection`): validation, `connections.json` store, passwords in
  Windows Credential Manager, and a manager that keeps profiles and credentials consistent.
- `qryvanta-cli connections list [--json]`.
- SQL Server driver (`internal/dialect/mssql`, go-mssqldb): SQL Server and Windows authentication,
  strict/mandatory/optional encryption with certificate validation, and TCP, named pipes and
  shared memory, so local SQL Server Express works out of the box.
- Connection pool (`connection.Pool`): connection test, connect/disconnect, per-profile limits,
  timeouts, cancellation, and sanitized errors that keep the SQL Server error number.
- `qryvanta-cli connections add|test|remove`, with passwords read only through `--password-stdin`.
- Integration tests (`-tags integration`) configured through `QRYVANTA_TEST_MSSQL_*` variables.

### Changed

- Profiles with read-only application intent must name a database (a SQL Server requirement).

- Architecture document, roadmap, and Phase 1 plan.
- Wails v3 desktop application and `qryvanta-cli`, sharing one Go core.
- Configuration with validation and atomic saves. An invalid file is moved aside at desktop startup.
- Structured JSON logging with secret redaction and size-based rotation.
- Application shell: header, explorer, workspace, output panel, analysis panel, and status bar.
  Panels are resizable and collapsible, with dark and light themes.
- Settings dialog backed by the real configuration, with per-field validation errors.
- Architecture test that keeps the core free of Wails.
- GitHub issue forms (bug, feature, SQL logic case, task), PR template, CODEOWNERS, Dependabot,
  Code of Conduct, and a CI workflow (Go, frontend, and the Wails desktop build on Windows).
